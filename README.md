Nothing to see here
===
Nothing to see here is a two-way encryption algorithm, using an advanced caesar cipher technique with multiple salting. Generates hashes (must be longer than the input-strings) of specified length using a predetermined alphabet. Every input-string can be generated into 62 different hashes (two alphabet-lenghts + length of all digits).
